# Roleplay

The project provides:
 * Keyboard Player control
 * Levels(locations) switching
 * Player stats improving
 * Basic AI (keep target on the player, move and attack)
 * UI controls
 * WebSocket connection

The player shares his location and rotation, but not AI players.

Each player has "his own" AI players and fire-bullets in the game.
